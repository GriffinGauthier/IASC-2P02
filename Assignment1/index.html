      <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
      <p><spam class="clickable" id="part-one">From inside the cave...</spam></p>

      <p>Within a deep cave there is a group of people that have never known anything other than the dark damp interiors of the place they call home. All of them live with wide smiles on their faces, their grins reaching ear to ear. The reason they do this is to please their god, Akku. Akku takes the form of a large face that appears on one of the cave walls. It is near this wall where the cave people set up an altar to their god. They leave offerings for them, and even hold celebrations to celebrate their god. This is done in the hopes of pleasing Akku, and making sure that they don’t upset their god. The cave people know when their god wants something, as they make sure to show their unrest in their movements. When their god grows broad or uneasy, the great face of Akku will start to move up and down a bit. Signalling to their followers that it is time for offerings, prayers, or celebrations. If Akku is pleased by the cave people’s actions then their face will start to move up and down even more, moving faster to show how pleased they are. This will continue until their great face disappears and leaves. Before returning once more to start the cycle all over again. <spam class="clickable" id="first-change">First change goes here</spam>. <spam class="clickable" id="second-change">Second change goes here</spam></p>

      <p>Nick Sousanis’s concept of Flatness is a way of thinking about how knowledge and communication can be represented in a more inclusive, interconnected, and visually dynamic way. Flatness isn’t just about two-dimensionality in the literal sense but also a metaphor for how we can break down traditional hierarchies of knowledge, perception, and understanding. When it comes to what the concept of Flatness means to me, flatness symbolizes an approach where different forms of knowledge and modes of representation are integrated and given equal weight. Such as visual, textual, and spatial for an example. It’s a way to represent complexity and interactivity without privileging one form over another, allowing for multiple perspectives and layers of meaning to coexist in a unified space. The people in the cave, in their isolated world, interpret the actions and presence of their god Akku through their limited experiences within the cave. Their worldview is shaped entirely by what they perceive from the large face of Akku on the cave wall, which becomes a focal point for their understanding of their reality and their sense of meaning. Because the people have never seen anything outside the cave, they don’t know any other way to interpret what happens within it. Their entire belief system is grounded in this one-dimensional interaction with the god's face and its movements. The cave people’s worldview is flat because they understand everything through a singular, visual representation. That being the face of their god. The shifting of the face, whether moving up and down or becoming uneasy, is the only way they know to interpret events, signals, or changes in their environment. There is no other context or deeper understanding beyond what they see in front of them.</p>

      <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
      <p><spam class="clickable" id="part-two">From outside the cave...</spam></p>

      <p>While the inside of the cave is dark and grey, the world outside of the cave is anything but. Outside the cave, was a beautiful lush and bright world with a town not too far from the entrance of the cave. Within the town there are many people going about their day under the warm and bright light of the sun. There are farmers, constructors, shopkeepers, and even performers in the middle of the streets playing songs and tunes that the whole town could hear and listen to, but was too far from the cave to be noticed from there. Around the entrance of the cave was a strange device that was built long long ago. A device that consists of two long poles supporting a smiley face. One of the poles moves the face up and down while the other moves it back and forth. Everyday, someone is assigned to this machine and is trusted to maintain it and start it if they see fit. Sometimes those who monitor it don’t turn it on at all while others like to have a bit too much fun with it. Sometimes people like to hit the circular eyes, causing them to spin back and forth and some even turn the smiley face into a frown. When this happens, people swear they can hear mad howling coming from deep within the cave however, no one ever dares to go into the cave to see what it is about. <spam class="clickable" id="thrid-change">Thrid change goes here</spam>. <spam class="clickable" id="fourth-change">Fourth change goes here</spam></p>

      <p>Nick Sousanis’s concept of Seeing Double refers to the idea of perceiving multiple layers of meaning or perspectives at the same time. It’s the recognition that reality isn’t just a singular, fixed view, but a complex combination of experiences, interpretations, and truths. Seeing Double challenges us to recognize that there can be more than one way of understanding the world, and sometimes those perspectives might even contradict one another, yet still coexist. It’s about breaking free from rigid, linear thinking and allowing for multiple, often simultaneous, interpretations. In the context of the cave, the events happening outside the cave cause the shadows inside the cave to shift and change. The people outside are seeing a physical, dynamic world: they see the smiling face moving up and down and back and forth, and sometimes even altering its expression with a frown. This lively interaction with the machine produces shadows that are cast onto the walls of the cave. The people inside, however, only experience these changes through the shadows that appear on the wall. They don’t see the machine or the people outside; they only see a distorted, symbolic representation of the movements happening beyond their reach. For the people inside the cave, these shadows become their entire reality. They interpret the changing shadows as the will of their god, Akku, whose face they believe to be present on the wall. The subtle shifts in the shadows become significant movements, signaling to the cave dwellers when to act or how to please their god. Meanwhile, the people outside see the lively, mechanical device and understand that it is a human creation, manipulated at will by those around it. However, there is a disconnect: the outside world’s vibrant activities never directly inform or influence the people inside the cave in a clear way. The connection between the two realms is established only through the shifting shadows, where the people inside, through their limited perception, see the reality outside but interpret it in a distorted, simplified manner. </p>
